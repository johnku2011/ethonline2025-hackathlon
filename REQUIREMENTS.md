# PyUSD Subscription Platform - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** PyUSD Subscription Platform  
**Hackathon:** ETHGlobal Hackathon  
**Blockchain:** Arbitrum  
**Primary Token:** PyUSD (PayPal USD)

### Concept

A decentralized subscription platform where users pay yearly subscriptions in PyUSD. Users who complete the full year receive their principal back plus accrued interest rewards. Early cancellations forfeit the interest, which goes to the service provider.

---

## Core Value Proposition

1. **For Users:** Get rewarded for commitment - complete 1 year, earn 4.5% APY on your subscription payment
2. **For Providers:** Reduce churn with financial incentives, earn forfeited interest from early cancellations
3. **For Ecosystem:** Innovative subscription model leveraging PyUSD's interest-bearing properties

---

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **Framework:** Next.js (React)
- **Language:** TypeScript + JavaScript
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Web3 Integration:** RainbowKit + Wagmi
- **Code Quality:** Husky, Prettier, ESLint

### Smart Contracts

- **Framework:** Hardhat
- **Language:** Solidity
- **Network:** Arbitrum
- **Testing:** Hardhat + Chai

### Blockchain Integration

- **Chain:** Arbitrum (mainnet/testnet)
- **Token:** PyUSD (ERC-20)
- **Wallet Connection:** RainbowKit

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Multi-Provider Platform

#### 1.1 Provider Registration

- Any wallet address can register as a service provider
- Providers must set:
  - Business name
  - Description
  - Subscription price (in PyUSD)
  - Service category (optional)
- On-chain storage of provider metadata (or IPFS hash)

#### 1.2 Provider Dashboard

- View total subscribers
- View total PyUSD locked
- View active vs cancelled subscriptions
- Calculate projected vs actual interest earnings
- Withdraw accumulated interest from cancelled subscriptions

### 2. Subscription Management

#### 2.1 User Subscription Flow

1. Browse available service providers
2. Select a provider and view their offering
3. Approve PyUSD spending (if not already approved)
4. Subscribe by paying yearly subscription amount
5. View subscription status and time remaining
6. Option to cancel subscription at any time

#### 2.2 Subscription States

- **Active:** User has paid, time remaining < 365 days
- **Completed:** User held subscription for full 365 days
- **Cancelled:** User cancelled before 365 days

#### 2.3 Subscription Completion

- After 365 days, user can claim:
  - Original principal (subscription payment)
  - Interest rewards (4.5% APY calculated)
- Smart contract releases funds to user

#### 2.4 Early Cancellation

- User can cancel anytime
- Receives original principal back
- Forfeits all interest rewards
- Forfeited interest goes to service provider

### 3. Interest Model

#### 3.1 Fixed APY Assumption

- **Rate:** 4.5% APY (configurable constant)
- **Calculation:** `interest = principal Ã— 0.045`
- **Distribution:**
  - Full year completion: User gets 100% of interest
  - Early cancellation: Provider gets 100% of forfeited interest

#### 3.2 Interest Tracking

- Track per-subscription interest allocation
- Calculate interest at subscription start
- Lock interest amount in contract
- Release to user (if completed) or provider (if cancelled)

## Smart Contract Requirements

### Contract Architecture

#### Main Contracts

**1. SubscriptionFactory.sol**

- Manages provider registration
- Creates subscription offerings
- Tracks all providers and subscriptions

**2. SubscriptionVault.sol**

- Holds PyUSD from subscribers
- Manages subscription lifecycle
- Calculates and distributes interest
- Handles claims and cancellations

#### Key Functions

##### Provider Functions

```solidity
function registerProvider(
    string memory name,
    string memory description,
    uint256 subscriptionPrice
) external returns (uint256 providerId)

function withdrawProviderInterest() external returns (uint256 amount)
```

##### User/Subscriber Functions

```solidity
function subscribe(uint256 providerId) external

function cancelSubscription(uint256 subscriptionId) external

function claimRewards(uint256 subscriptionId) external

function getSubscriptionStatus(uint256 subscriptionId)
    external view returns (
        address subscriber,
        uint256 providerId,
        uint256 startTime,
        uint256 principal,
        uint256 interest,
        SubscriptionState state
    )
```

##### View Functions

```solidity
function getProvider(uint256 providerId) external view returns (Provider memory)

function getUserSubscriptions(address user) external view returns (uint256[] memory)

function getProviderSubscriptions(uint256 providerId) external view returns (uint256[] memory)

function calculateInterest(uint256 principal) public pure returns (uint256)
```

##### Testnet-Only Demo Functions

```solidity
// Only available on testnet for demo purposes
function fastForwardTime(uint256 subscriptionId, uint256 daysToSkip)
    external
    onlyTestnet

function resetSubscription(uint256 subscriptionId)
    external
    onlyOwner
    onlyTestnet

function isTestnet() public view returns (bool)
```

**Purpose:**

- `fastForwardTime`: Simulates time passage for demo (makes subscription appear older)
- `resetSubscription`: Resets subscription state for repeated demos
- `isTestnet`: Returns true if contract is on testnet, prevents deployment to mainnet with demo features

**Security Note:** These functions MUST be disabled or removed before mainnet deployment

#### Faucet Contract (Testnet Only)

```solidity
contract PyUSDFaucet {
    IERC20 public pyusd;
    uint256 public constant DRIP_AMOUNT = 1000 * 10**6; // 1000 PyUSD

    mapping(address => uint256) public lastDrip;
    uint256 public constant COOLDOWN = 1 hours;

    function fundWallet(address recipient) external {
        require(block.timestamp >= lastDrip[recipient] + COOLDOWN, "Cooldown active");
        lastDrip[recipient] = block.timestamp;
        pyusd.transfer(recipient, DRIP_AMOUNT);
    }
}
```

#### Security Requirements

- ReentrancyGuard on all fund-moving functions
- Access control (only subscriber can cancel their subscription)
- Proper state management (can't claim twice, etc.)
- SafeERC20 for token transfers
- Pausable functionality (emergency stop)
- Input validation on all functions

#### Events

```solidity
event ProviderRegistered(uint256 indexed providerId, address indexed provider, string name)
event Subscribed(uint256 indexed subscriptionId, address indexed subscriber, uint256 indexed providerId, uint256 amount)
event SubscriptionCancelled(uint256 indexed subscriptionId, address indexed subscriber, uint256 refund)
event RewardsClaimed(uint256 indexed subscriptionId, address indexed subscriber, uint256 principal, uint256 interest)
event InterestWithdrawn(uint256 indexed providerId, address indexed provider, uint256 amount)
```
